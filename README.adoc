== clap bug?

This program defines a clap command that does nothing.  You would run it like this:

```
$ cargo run -- one two
...
Cli { my_arg: None, command: One(OneSubcommands { command: Two }) }
```

If you forget the second subcommand, you get a useful usage message:

```
$ cargo run -- one 
Usage: clap-message one [MY_ARG] <COMMAND>

Commands:
  two   
  help  Print this message or the help of the given subcommand(s)

Arguments:
  [MY_ARG]  [env: MY_ARG=]

Options:
  -h, --help  Print help
```

If you forget the second subcommand _but also specify the optional environment variable `MY_ARG`_, you get an error message with a more abbreviated help message:

```
dap@zathras clap-bug $ MY_ARG= cargo run -- one
error: 'clap-message one' requires a subcommand but one was not provided
  [subcommands: two, help]

Usage: clap-message one [MY_ARG] <COMMAND>

For more information, try '--help'.
```

you _don't_ get that error message in that case, even though logically we're still passing the same argument:
